			<!-- lion description -->
			<p class="text"> Prides are family units that
				 may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's
				  lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males
					 eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.</p>
